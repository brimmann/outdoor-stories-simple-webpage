                                    This was the most boring day for us. We used to fish with handmade rod. One day we decide to buy a modern
                                    rod that is made with machine and the people of the modern world use it. We went to the city and bought one.
                                    We came back so happy, thinking we would catch a lot of fish and will enjoy more but we didn't know the
                                    fish don't like changes.

                                    Nature is everything for us. At the  start of the spring we always plant trees. That day I and Adam came to
                                    the forest after the sunrise. For breakfast we hunted down a rabbet. It was delicious and full of energy so
                                    we can work firmly for the rest of the day.
                                </p>

                                    That day we came to the river before sunrise. The weather at that time is usually cold so we had our jackets
                                    put on. We walked toward our usual hunting spot to set and watch for the flocks of ducks. We lit a fire.
                                    On that morning we didn't see any duck flock around so we decided to find something else for the breakfast.
